# WolfPackInsight  

## Overview  
**WolfPackInsight** is a social media analysis tool that organizes and visualizes user connections across different platforms. The software calculates degrees of separation between two users and identifies whether a connection path exists between them.  

## Features  
- **Connection Analysis**: Determines relationships between users based on available social media data.  
- **Degrees of Separation Calculation**: Finds the shortest path between two users or reports if no connection exists.  
- **Optimized Performance**: Implements efficient data structures such as graphs, trees, and maps for scalability.  
- **High Test Coverage**: Achieved **~95% test coverage** using **JUnit test cases** to ensure robust functionality.  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Utilized **Jenkins** for automated testing and validation of project updates.  
- **Version Control**: Maintained and updated the project using **GitHub** to track changes and improvements.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WolfPackInsight.git
   ```

   ```
3. Build the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or compile using:  
   ```sh
   javac -cp .:junit-4.12.jar WolfPackInsight.java
   ```

## Usage
